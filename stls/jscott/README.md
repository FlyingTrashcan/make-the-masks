# J. Scott mask designs

These files are under consideration for adoption as the "V2" Montana Mask design. They feature size letters on the mask interior, larger eyelets to make threading elastic easier, and a filter that offers interior relief for the user's lips.

Notes on printing: The filter should be printed with the flange facing up. There is enough contouring on the filter to allow the flange to print without supports. All the files are the same size, they merely have different letters. The recommended amount to resize the body and filter before printing are:


- XL: 110%
- L: 100%
- M: 90%
- S: 80%
